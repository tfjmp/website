## Course Description

## Class format

This is a seminar type class.
Every class we will discuss a different paper.
I have selected a mix of recent and older papers.
There will be two presenters during each class.
Each presenter will play a different role: the role of the Advocate and the role of the Critic.
The Advocate should play a role similar to that of the original authors and try to sell the work to the audience.
On the other hand, the Critic while remaining objective should towards the end of the presentation highlight the flows of the paper and convince the audience that the paper is no good.
Each presentation will last 12-14 minutes after which we will take a short break (5-10 minutes) before starting an in class discussion about the paper.
You should expect to present at least 2 or 3 times during the term depending on the number of students registered.

In order to do well during your presentation, you should remember to stick to your role (Advocate or Critic).
Further, you do not need to spend too much time explaining the basic of the paper, everyone in class will have already read it.
What add value to the presentation is your opinion and the insights you can extract from the paper! This what you should focus on.
