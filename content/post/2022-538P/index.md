## Course Description

The goal of this course is to expose students to a variety of topics in Systems Security.
Security inherently touch on all areas of computer science.
Therefore, this course was designed as a *breadth* course, addressed to all students in the department.
The core idea underlying the course is to bring together a diversity of view points to generate interesting discussions.
On the other hand, we could also easily design a *depth* course focused on any of the topics we will discuss.
The project component is the opportunity for students to explore one of those topics in more depth.
Students are free (and encouraged) to apply their expertise (ML, PL, HCI, architecture etc.) to solve a specific Systems Security problem.
Some of the papers have been selected explicitly to highlight the interdisciplinary nature of Systems Security and to showcase
how diverse perspectives are welcomed and appreciated.

## Course Requirements



## Course Objectives

## Class format

This is a seminar type class.
Every class we will discuss a different paper.
I have selected a mix of recent and older papers.
There will be two presenters during each class.
Each presenter will play a different role: the role of the Advocate and the role of the Critic.
The Advocate should play a role similar to that of the original authors and try to sell the work to the audience.
On the other hand, the Critic while remaining objective should towards the end of the presentation highlight the flows of the paper and convince the audience that the paper is no good.
Each presentation will last 12-14 minutes after which we will take a short break (5-10 minutes) before starting an in class discussion about the paper.
You should expect to present at least 2 or 3 times during the term depending on the number of students registered.

In order to do well during your presentation, you should remember to stick to your role (Advocate or Critic).
Further, you do not need to spend too much time explaining the basic of the paper, everyone in class will have already read it.
What add value to the presentation is your opinion and the insights you can extract from the paper! This what you should focus on.
