abstract = "There is a clear, outstanding need for new security mechanisms that allow data to be managed and controlled within the cloud-enabled Internet of Things. Towards this, we propose an approach based on Information Flow Control (IFC) that allows: (1) the continuous, end-to-end enforcement of data flow policy, and (2) the generation of provenance-like audit logs to demonstrate policy adherence and contractual/regulatory compliance. Further, we discuss the role of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in supporting such a system, by providing hardware roots of trust. TPMs can be leveraged to validate software configurations, including the IFC enforcement mechanism, both in the cloud and externally via remote attestation."
