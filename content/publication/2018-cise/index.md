abstract = "Open data and open-source software may be part of the solution to science’s “reproducibility crisis”, but they are insufficient to guarantee reproducibility. Requiring minimal end-user expertise, encapsulator creates a “time capsule” with reproducible code in a self-contained computational environment. encapsulator provides end-users with a fully-featured desktop environment for reproducible research."
