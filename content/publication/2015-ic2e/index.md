abstract = "Security is an ongoing challenge in cloud computing. Currently, cloud consumers have few mechanisms for managing their data within the cloud provider's infrastructure. Information Flow Control (IFC) involves attaching labels to data, to govern its flow throughout a system. We have worked on kernel-level IFC enforcement to protect data flows within a virtual machine (VM). This paper makes the case for, and demonstrates the feasibility of an IFC-enabled messaging middleware, to enforce IFC within and across applications, containers, VMs, and hosts. We detail how such middleware can integrate with local (kernel) enforcement mechanisms, and highlight the benefits of separating data management policy from application/service-logic."
