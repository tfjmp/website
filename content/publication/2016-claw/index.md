abstract = "The adoption of cloud computing is increasing and its use is becoming widespread in many sectors. As the proportion of services provided using cloud computing increases, legal and regulatory issues are becoming more significant. In this paper we explore how an Information Flow Audit (IFA) mechanism, that provides key data regarding provenance, can be used to verify compliance with regulatory and contractual duty, and survey potential extensions. We explore the use of IFA for such a purpose through a smart electricity metering use case derived from a French Data Protection Agency recommendation."
