**Contacting me**

If you are planning to apply, please, do so through the UBC system, if you select me as a potential supervisor in the online form, I will review your application.
**I cannot process applications sent via e-mail** and I will not review application packages sent by e-mail.
I do not process applications before the closing deadline (December 15th).
Further, note that [Systopia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) receive several hundred applications every year, and it takes a non-trivial amount of time to review them carefully.
We aim (but cannot guarantee) for all applicants to hear back from us by mid-April.
**I will not discuss admission outside of the departmental admission process.**

Outside of this, please feel free to contact me if you have **specific** research questions.

**If you are enrolled in a PhD program outside of UBC** and are considering joining my lab as a **Visiting International Research Student**.
Please, review carefully the information provided on [UBC website](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-graduate-and-postdoctoral-studies/classification-students/visiting-graduate-student) before contacting me.
Ensure you have discussed with your home institution and supervisor first.

I am looking to work with students from all background (first generation students, and students from underrepresented and marginalized groups are encouraged to apply).
Please, visit the prospective applicant page on [UBC website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) and on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective).
You can also find information about: [financial support](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/funding/financial), [application fee waivers](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/online-application-fee), [minimum requirements for admission into graduate studies](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/eligibility), and [minimum English proficiency requirements](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/application-components-required-documents/english-proficiency-requirement).
You may also look at [this page](https://tfjmp.org/post/working-with-me/) which describes my expectations when working with graduate students.
Finally, you should have a look at [UBC cost calculator](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/tuition-fees-cost-living/cost-living#calctable).

**Note:** The Master of Science in Computer Science at UBC is a research degree. Students are expected to conduct research, submit papers for publication,
and eventually write a thesis. You can find more information on the university [website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-computer-science). While applications are not reviewed with the same expectations as those of PhD applicants, you should clearly demonstrate you
have an interest and the capacity to conduct research.

## A few facts

* You must apply [online](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science).
* Do check the [application deadline](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions) on UBCâ€™s website.
* The department starts processing applications in January for the next academic year.
* Students are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty members.
* Master and PhD applications are reviewed by the same committee. The [PhD track](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective-grads/grad-programs/phd-track-msc-program) is ideal for candidates who ultimately want to do a PhD, but do not feel ready yet.
* Even if you are well fitted for my group, I cannot guarantee admission.

## Before applying

* Have a look at my [publications](https://tfjmp.org/publication/).
* Identify matching interests.
* Understand that I will not supervise students outside of my area of expertise.
* Find a set of papers which aligns with your interests.
* Read the abstracts.
* Read at least one paper in full.

## What to address in your statement of intent?

* Check the guidelines on the [department website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/statement-of-intent)
* An SoI must address the three following points: 1) show you know what is research, 2) describe the research you have done, and 3) discuss what research you would like to do.
* The SoI is **not** about your life story.
* The relationship between a student and their advisor is an extremely important one and it will hopefully last for years.
* The commonality of interest should be clear from your statement.
* Listing half a dozen potential advisors from very different areas is most probably detrimental to your application.
* On the other hand, co-supervision is common and can be very positive.
* Therefore, link clearly potential advisors to your experience and your aspirations.
* Everything else being equal, an applicant that understands and shows **why** they should be working with a specific advisor are more likely to be successful.
* This is my personal opinion and may not be universally true.

## If you get an offer letter

* Do not hesistate to get in touch to discuss specific details.
* Funding amounts on the offer letter is a **guaranteed minimum**, do contact me to discuss the actual amount.
* Apply for graduate accomodation as early as possible. Check the [information online](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/getting-started/graduate-students/).
