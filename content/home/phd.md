# PhDs

I am looking to work with students from all background (first generation students, and students from underrepresented and marginalized groups are encouraged to apply) and at all level (undergraduate students, master’s students, and PhD students).
Please, visit the prospective applicant page on [UBC website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) and on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective).
You can also find information about financial matters on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/funding/financial).
Don't hesitate to get in touch with me via [e-mail](mailto:tfjmp@cs.ubc.ca) but, please, do read the following suggestions before doing so.

## A few facts

* Do check the [application deadline](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions) on UBC’s website.
* The department starts processing applications in January for the next academic year.
* Students are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty members.
* Even if you are well fitted for my group, I cannot guarantee admission.

## Before contacting me

* Have a look at my [publications](https://tfjmp.org/publication/).
* Identify matching interests.
* Understand that I will not supervise students outside of my area of expertise.
* Find a set of papers which aligns with your interests.
* Read the abstracts.
* Read at least one paper in full.

## What to send when contacting me?

* CV/resume
* Transcripts
* Why do you want to work with me? (one paragraph)
* Why do you want to work on this topic? (one paragraph)
* Which paper(s) did you read and why did you find it interesting? (one paragraph)
* Previous research experience (if any)
* Summary of your undergraduate/master thesis (if any)

## Some ideas

- By observing workload executions it is possible to optimize the configuration of a big data analytics framework
[[1](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2020-kdd.pdf),[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08002.pdf),[3](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2020-bigdata.pdf)].
How far can such techniques be improved?
Can we apply similar techniques to other domains?
What are the obstacles to a practical deployment?
- Provenance-based intrusion detection [[4](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2020-ndss.pdf),[5](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2021-USENIXsec.pdf)] open new opportunities in intrusion detection research.
Further, we have demonstrated that capture and runtime processing were practical [[6](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2018-ccs.pdf),[7](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2017-socc.pdf)].
How far can we improve such techniques?
Can we learn from more traditional host-based intrusion detection techniques?
Can we improve capture accuracy and trustworthiness while reducing overhead?
Can we automatically explain an intrusion?
- Imagine a resource limited edge environment where applications are deployed using container technology (maybe an environment such as kubedge [[8](https://kubeedge.io/en/)] and k3s [[9](https://k3s.io/)]).
Applications are provided by third parties and may be malicious or get compromised.
Can we design an intrusion prevention/detection system that works with the limited resources available to edge platforms?
How can we detect external (e.g., attacker attempting to compromise vulnerable applications) and internal (e.g., malicious applications installed on an edge node) threats?
How minimal can our monitoring system be?
How complex the detection algorithm needs to be?
How can nodes owned by different parties share knowledge about threats safely?

# Postdocs

## SYNERGIA project

We are looking for two enthusiastic, self-motivated individuals to contribute to the Innovate UK-funded SYNERGIA project on Cyber Security for the Internet of Things.

SYNERGIA will devise, develop and demonstrate a novel, secure-by-design, endpoint-to-core IoT platform for large-scale networks of low-power resource-constrained devices. The platform will provide users with distributed processing capability at the Edge as a service. Project outcomes will be showcased at two demonstration events.

You will contribute to an ambitious research programme and industry R&D on scalable, secure configuration management and control of IoT systems; secure connectivity for battery-powered resource-constrained devices; edge-based AI for cyber security of IoT systems.
