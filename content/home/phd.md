We ([Mathias Lecuyer](http://mathias.lecuyer.me/) and [Thomas Pasquier](https://tfjmp.org/)) are looking for students interested in [pursuing a Ph.D.](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) at the intersection of causal discovery and automated system optimization. Successful applicants will join the [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) in the [department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). We are looking for candidates with expertise and experience in either Systems or ML research.
{{% /callout %}}

I am looking to work with students from all background (first generation students, and students from underrepresented and marginalized groups are encouraged to apply) and at all level (undergraduate students, master’s students, and PhD students).
Please, visit the prospective applicant page on [UBC website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) and on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective).
You can also find information about: [financial support](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/funding/financial), [application fee waivers](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/online-application-fee), [minimum requirements for admission into graduate studies](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/eligibility), and [minimum English proficiency requirements](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/application-components-required-documents/english-proficiency-requirement).
You may also look at [this page](https://tfjmp.org/post/working-with-me/) which describes my expectations when working with graduate students.
Finally, you should have a look at [UBC cost calculator](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/tuition-fees-cost-living/cost-living#calctable).

**Note:** The Master of Science in Computer Science at UBC is a research degree. Students are expected to conduct research, submit papers for publication,
and eventually write a thesis. You can find more information on the university [website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-computer-science). While applications are not reviewed with the same expectations as those of PhD applicants, you should clearly demonstrate you
have an interest and the capacity to conduct research.

## A few facts

* You must apply [online](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science).
* Do check the [application deadline](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions) on UBC’s website.
* The department starts processing applications in January for the next academic year.
* Students are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty members.
* Master and PhD applications are reviewed by the same committee. The [PhD track](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective-grads/grad-programs/phd-track-msc-program) is ideal for candidates who ultimately want to do a PhD, but do not feel ready yet.
* Even if you are well fitted for my group, I cannot guarantee admission.

## Before applying

* Have a look at my [publications](https://tfjmp.org/publication/).
* Identify matching interests.
* Understand that I will not supervise students outside of my area of expertise.
* Find a set of papers which aligns with your interests.
* Read the abstracts.
* Read at least one paper in full.

## What to address in your statement of intent?

* Check the guidelines on the [department website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/statement-of-intent)
* An SoI must address the three following points: 1) show you know what is research, 2) describe the research you have done, and 3) discuss what research you would like to do.
* The SoI is **not** about your life story.
* The relationship between a student and their advisor is an extremely important one and it will hopefully last for years.
* The commonality of interest should be clear from your statement.
* Listing half a dozen potential advisors from very different areas is most probably detrimental to your application.
* On the other hand, co-supervision is common and can be very positive.
* Therefore, link clearly potential advisors to your experience and your aspirations.
* Everything else being equal, an applicant that understands and shows **why** they should be working with a specific advisor are more likely to be successful.
* This is my personal opinion and may not be universally true.

## Contacting me

Don't hesitate to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:tfjmp@cs.ubc.ca) if you have any questions or need further precision/information.
If you are planning to apply, please, do so through the UBC system, if you select me as a potential supervisor in the online form, I will review your application.
**I cannot process applications sent via e-mail** and I will not review application packages sent by e-mail.
I do not process applications before the closing deadline (December 15th).
Further, note that [Systopia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) receive several hundred applications every year, and it takes a non-trivial amount of time to review them carefully.
We aim (but cannot guarantee) for all applicants to hear back from us by mid-April.
