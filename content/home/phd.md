# PhD and MS students

I am looking to work with students from all background (first generation students, and students from underrepresented and marginalized groups are encouraged to apply) and at all level (undergraduate students, master’s students, and PhD students).
Please, visit the prospective applicant page on [UBC website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) and on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective).
You can also find information about financial matters on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/funding/financial).
Don't hesitate to get in touch with me via [e-mail](mailto:tfjmp@cs.ubc.ca) but, please, do read the following suggestions before doing so.

## A few facts

* Do check the [application deadline](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions) on UBC’s website.
* The department starts processing applications in January for the next academic year.
* Students are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty members.
* Even if you are well fitted for my group, I cannot guarantee admission.

## Before contacting me

* Have a look at my [publications](https://tfjmp.org/publication/).
* Identify matching interests.
* Understand that I will not supervise students outside of my area of expertise.
* Find a set of papers which aligns with your interests.
* Read the abstracts.
* Read at least one paper in full.

## What to send when contacting me?

* CV/resume
* Transcripts
* Why do you want to work with me? (one paragraph)
* Why do you want to work on this topic? (one paragraph)
* Which paper(s) did you read and why did you find it interesting? (one paragraph)
* Previous research experience (if any)
* Summary of your undergraduate/master thesis (if any)

## Statement of Intent

* Check the guidelines on the [department website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/statement-of-intent)
* The relationship between a student and their advisor is an extremely important one and it will hopefully last for years
* The commonality of interest should be clear from your statement
* Listing half a dozen potential advisors from very different areas is most probably detrimental to your application
* On the other hand, co-supervision is common and can be very positive
* Therefore, link clearly potential advisors to your experience and your aspirations
* Everything else being equal, an applicant that understands and shows **why** they should be working with a specific advisor are more likely to be successful
* This is my personal opinion and may not be universally true
