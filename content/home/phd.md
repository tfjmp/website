If you are a PhD student interested by my work and a collaboration, I am always happy to welcome **Visiting International Research Student** in my lab.
Please, review carefully the information provided on [UBC website](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/faculties-colleges-and-schools/faculty-graduate-and-postdoctoral-studies/classification-students/visiting-graduate-student) before contacting me.
You may want to explore the MITACS' [Globalink Research Award](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-award/) program as a potential source of funding.
Ensure you have discussed with your home institution and supervisor first.

**Contacting me**

If you are planning to apply, please, do so through the UBC system, if you select me as a potential supervisor in the online form, I will review your application.
**I cannot process applications sent via e-mail** and I will not review application packages sent by e-mail.
I do not process applications before the closing deadline (December 15th).
The department receive around 2,000 applications every year and it takes a non-trivial amount of time to review them carefully.
We aim (but cannot guarantee) for all applicants to hear back from us by mid-April.
**I will not discuss admission outside of the departmental admission process.**

Please feel free to contact me if you have **specific** research questions.

I am looking to work with students from all background (first generation students, and students from underrepresented and marginalized groups are encouraged to apply).
Please, visit the prospective applicant page on [UBC website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science) and on [the CS website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective).
You can also find information about: [financial support](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/funding/financial), [application fee waivers](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/online-application-fee), [minimum requirements for admission into graduate studies](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/eligibility), and [minimum English proficiency requirements](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions/application-components-required-documents/english-proficiency-requirement).
You may also look at [this page](https://tfjmp.org/post/working-with-me/) which describes my expectations when working with graduate students.
Finally, you should have a look at [UBC cost calculator](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/tuition-fees-cost-living/cost-living#calctable).

The Master of Science in Computer Science at UBC is a research degree. Students are expected to conduct research, submit papers for publication,
and eventually write a thesis. You can find more information on the university [website](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-computer-science). While applications are not reviewed with the same expectations as those of PhD applicants, you should clearly demonstrate you
have an interest and the capacity to conduct research.

## A few facts

* You must apply [online](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science).
* Do check the [application deadline](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/admissions) on UBC’s website.
* The department starts processing applications in January for the next academic year.
* Students are admitted by the department, not by individual faculty members.
* Master and PhD applications are reviewed by the same committee. The [PhD track](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective-grads/grad-programs/phd-track-msc-program) is ideal for candidates who ultimately want to do a PhD, but do not feel ready yet.
* Even if you are well fitted for my group, I cannot guarantee admission.

## Before applying

* Have a look at my [publications](https://tfjmp.org/publication/).
* Identify matching interests.
* Understand that I will not supervise students outside of my area of expertise.
* Find a set of papers which aligns with your interests.
* Read the abstracts.
* Read at least one paper in full.

## What to address in your statement of intent?

* **Start with the official guidance.** Review the [department website](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/statement-of-intent) for any required information, length limits, or formatting.
* **Cover three essentials.** Demonstrate you understand research; describe the research **you** have done; outline the research you want to pursue.
* **Mention funding.** Briefly note scholarships you hold or plan to apply for.
* **Stay focused.** The SoI is not your life story; prioritize intellectual trajectory, evidence of research ability, and where the degree fits in your career plans.
* **Emphasize advisor fit.** The advisor–student relationship is crucial and often lasts for years. Your SoI should make the commonality of interests obvious.
* **Be selective about potential advisors.** Listing many names across unrelated areas usually weakens your case. If you are considering co-supervision explain the intellectual thread that links advisors.
* **Make the match explicit.** Clearly connect specific faculty to your past experience and future aims: why this lab, why now, and what you would contribute.
* **All else equal, specificity wins.** Applicants who can articulate **why** a particular advisor and research direction are the right fit are more likely to be successful.
* These points reflect my personal perspective and may not be universally true.

## If you get an offer letter

* Do not hesistate to get in touch to discuss specific details.
* Funding amounts on the offer letter is a **guaranteed minimum**, do contact me to discuss the actual amount.
* Apply for graduate accomodation as early as possible. Check the [information online](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/getting-started/graduate-students/).
