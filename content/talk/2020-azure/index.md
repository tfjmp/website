abstract = "Thomas Pasquier is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Bristol (UK). Thomas has been working on how to make systems more transparent and how to use the insights gained. During today session, Thomas will discuss his work with colleagues at Cambridge on auto-tuning on the spark platform. We proposed an (open-source) extension to Spark which learns to automatically select good configuration as more workload are executed. This work was recently discussed in a [KDD article](https://tfjmp.org/files/publications/2020-kdd.pdf)."
