title = "Provenance-based Intrusion Detection"
abstract = "Whole-system provenance is the record of flows of information between kernel objects (e.g., files, task, sockets etc.). This information is represented as a directed acyclic graph that can be analysed to extract information about the execution of the system. Building on the DARPA transparent computing programme a number of research groups have explored means to develop provenance-based intrusion detection systems. In this talk, we will discuss how provenance can be captured and analysed to achieve such an objective."
