I will be [joining the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/news/2020/05/ubc-hires-three-new-systems-researchers-privacy-and-security) in Summer 2021. If you are considering a PhD, please, check [this](#phd). I am a [Lecturer (Assistant Professor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer#United_Kingdom) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/departments/computerscience/).
I am a member of the [Microsoft Cloud Computing Research Centre](http://www.mccrc.org/) where we explore research topics at the intersection of Computer Science and Law.
Before joining the University of Bristol, I held fellowships at Harvard University and the University of Cambridge.
I obtained my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Jean Bacon](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jmb25/) in 2016 at the University of Cambridge.

My primary research focus is the development of more transparent computer systems; my research includes topics such as whole-system provenance, computational experiments reproducibility, intrusion detection, privacy and compliance.
