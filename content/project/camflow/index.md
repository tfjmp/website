CamFlow stands for Cambridge information Flow architecture, the Cam is also the river that flows through Cambridge, UK. CamFlow is a Linux Security Module (LSM) designed to capture data provenance for the purpose of system audit. The whole-system provenance capture mechanism is highly configurable, and can fit the needs of many different type of applications. CamFlow can stack with existing security modules such as SELinux.
